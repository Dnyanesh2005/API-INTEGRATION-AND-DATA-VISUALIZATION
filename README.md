*DESCRITIPTION*


**In this task**, I worked on fetching real-time weather details for a city using the **OpenWeatherMap API** in **Python**. I learned how to send API requests, read JSON responses, and organize the results into a table with **Pandas**. I also created a bar graph using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to clearly show temperature, humidity, and pressure values.

**Key steps I followed:**

* Used **requests** to connect with the API and get live weather data
* Extracted useful information like temperature, humidity, pressure, and weather description
* Displayed the data neatly in a DataFrame
* Visualized the results through a bar chart

**Tools & resources:**

* Python libraries: **requests, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn**
* OpenWeatherMap API guide
* Google Colab for coding and testing
